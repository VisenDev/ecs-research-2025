   abstract = {An Entity Component System is a data-oriented architecture originally developed to streamline video game performance. Despite being quite new, Entity Component Systems are relatively well established within the video game industry due to the cutting edge nature of research into performance, especially around graphics. However, Entity Component Systems have not been widely examined or adopted outside of that industry. We propose adopting an Entity Component Systems framework to serve the needs of an Energy Service Interfaces. We examine the needs of an Energy Service Interface, give an overview of open-source Entity Component Systems (ECSs) libraries, examine some preliminary performance results for ECSs, and explore the traditional approach to fulfilling the needs of an Energy Service Interface (ESI) with database architectures.},
